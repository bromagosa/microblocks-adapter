# microblocks-adapter

This adapter makes it possible to expose small, inexpensive, programmable microcontroller boards as "web things" in the Mozilla WebThings Gateway.

Using [MicroBlocks](http://microblocks.fun) to program MCUs is intuitive and fun. Using the [Mozilla WebThings Gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway) to interact with the things you made is also intutive and fun. The sum is even greater than the parts!

Check out the examples and contribute your own.
